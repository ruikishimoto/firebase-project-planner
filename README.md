The app uses *Firebase Authentication* for authentication services of the app.  

The app uses *Firebase Cloud Firestore* for storing the project data and user data(except email and password).  

The app uses *Firebase Cloud Functions* for creating the backend of the site. This is what makes our app a serverless app. This is used to trigger notifications in our app.

The app uses *React / Redux* in the frontend which uses *Redux Firebase* to get and synchronize data in realtime.  

Finally, the app is deployed on firebase using *Firebase Hosting*.
